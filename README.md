# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Project Description

The bulk of this code was supplied by the organizer of my bootcamp. The goal of this exercise was to simplify the CSS code provided to make it easier to read and manage. Additonally, adding semantic tags to improve accessibility and flow in the attached HTML file.

## User Story 

AS A developer working on this site, 
I WANT to have a web application that is accessible and employs appropriate semantic HTML tags, 
SO THAT my site is easier for users with accessibility to use, easier for search engines to understand, and easier for developers to style and maintain.

AS A developer working on this site, 
I WANT to have a web application sytlesheet that employs the DRY principle, 
SO THAT my CSS does not contain redundant code and is clear and consise for other developers to manage and maintain.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
